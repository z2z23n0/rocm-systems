/// @details What a mutex guarantees is an absence: while it is held, the work
/// it excludes has not happened. An absence can otherwise only be asserted by
/// waiting and observing that nothing occurred, which proves nothing -- an
/// implementation that never takes the lock satisfies that check whenever the
/// machine is loaded enough to leave the excluded thread unscheduled, so the
/// test passes precisely when the system is least able to justify it.
///
/// Counting blocked writers turns the guarantee into something observable. A
/// waiter can be waited for, so exclusion becomes a fact rather than an
/// inference from elapsed time, and code that never acquires the lock never
/// raises the count and so fails rather than passing by accident.
///
/// The count is maintained only on the exclusive path, which is the contended
/// one worth observing; readers pay nothing for it.
