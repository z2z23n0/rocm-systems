/// @details Models the kernel's KFD event infrastructure: event creation,
/// signaling, reset, destruction, and blocking waits. Each event maintains a
/// per-event waiter list matching the kernel's wait_queue model — when an event
/// fires, only threads registered on that specific event are woken.
///
/// Event age semantics follow the real ROCR ↔ KFD protocol: ROCR passes
/// last_event_age=1 on every WAIT_EVENTS call. set_event/interrupt sets
/// event_age to 1; auto-reset clears it to 0. The wait predicate checks
/// event_age >= last_event_age for signal events only.
